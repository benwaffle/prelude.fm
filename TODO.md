- [ ] don't pass whole spotify api url to /api/spotify/liked-songs
- [ ] make the AI fill in the work number if missing
- [ ] use a DB MCP/turso cli + wikipedia/other sites to fill out the composers + works data
- [ ] use shadcn sonner so alerts show up in view
- [ ] handle multiple catalog numbers for a track like "Violin Concerto in E Minor, Op. 4 No. 2, RV 279: I. Allegro"
- [ ] use TS spotify sdk - https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2023-07-03-typescript-sdk
